Assumptions

In the Text Analysis tool:

    If the input text contains fewer than 10,000 words, a warning alert is shown for informational purposes, but the analysis still proceeds without restriction.

    Word classification categories (pronouns, prepositions, articles) only display non-zero counts. Words with zero frequency are omitted from the results to reduce clutter.

The entire project is hosted on GitHub Pages at https:/Janya19.github.io/Janya19/smp.html . All links and resources assume this structure unless modified.

All images (.jpg, .png, .webp) and the CV PDF file are stored in the root directory of the project and referenced using relative paths.

The dropdown filter for technical skills assumes that each skill item is tagged with a data-level attribute corresponding to one of the options in the select menu: "Beginner", "Intermediate", or "Advanced".
